I am an incoming doctoral student in Management Information Systems at Georgia State University. My research interest focuses on the economics of information, online labor markets, and entrepreneurship in the digital age. Method-wise, I often use Econometrics, Bayesian Statistics, and Hierarchical Linear Modeling.</p>

Before starting my Ph.D., I mainly worked in the space of process digitalization in both large organizations and start-ups. Inspired by the real-world experience, I decided to start my academic career to solve digital transformation questions that keep business owners and leaders awake at night.

In my free time, I groom my cat and shower her with love. I am a picky eater while being a lousy cook, which I have been working on without substantial progress. I learned to play board games a few years ago and become addicted to some of them. Besides being a desk mosquito, I have just taken up ballet and have a hard time memorizing all the moves.</p>
