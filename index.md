<p>
I am an incoming doctoral student in Management Information Systems at Georgia State University. I am interested in the economics of information, online labor markets, and entrepreneurship in the digital age. My interested methods include Econometrics, Bayesian Statistics, and Hierarchical Linear Modeling.</p>

<p>
Before starting my PhD, I mainly worked in the space of process digitalization in both large organizations and start-ups. Inspired by the real world experience, I decided to start my academic career to solve questions concerning digital transformation that keep business owners and leaders awake at night. </p>

In my free time, I groom my cat and shower her with love. I am a picky eater while being a lousy cook, which I have been working on without much progress. I just take up ballet and have a hard time memmorizing all the moves. </p>
