<p>
I am an incoming doctoral student in Management Information Systems at Georgia State University. I am interested in the economics of information, online labor markets, and entrepreneurship in the digital age. </p>

<p>
Before starting my PhD, I was tasked with process digitalization in both large organizations and start-ups. Inspired by the real world experience, I decided to start my academic career to solve questions concerning digital transformation that keep business leaders awake at night.
